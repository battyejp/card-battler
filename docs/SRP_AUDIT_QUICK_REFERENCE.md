# SRP Audit - Quick Reference

This document provides a quick reference guide to the SRP audit findings for easy navigation.

## Report Location
The full audit report is located at: `docs/SRP_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

## Key Statistics
- **Total Files Reviewed:** 92+ Dart files
- **Total Violations Found:** 9
- **Critical Violations:** 3
- **Moderate Violations:** 4
- **Minor Violations:** 2
- **Good Practices Documented:** 7

## Top Priority Violations (Recommended Order of Refactoring)

### 1. CoordinatorsManager (HIGH PRIORITY)
**File:** `lib/game/services/game/coordinators_manager.dart`  
**Lines:** 20-102  
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Effort:** HIGH  
**Why it matters:** This is a God Object that orchestrates creation of all game coordinators. Breaking it down would significantly improve testability, maintainability, and debugging.

**Recommended Action:** Break into specialized coordinator builders:
- PlayerCoordinatorsBuilder
- EnemyCoordinatorsBuilder  
- SceneCoordinatorsBuilder

### 2. LoadingScreen (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**File:** `lib/screens/loading_screen.dart`  
**Lines:** 11-45  
**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Effort:** LOW  
**Why it matters:** Mixes UI rendering with business logic and navigation. Simple to fix with high value.

**Recommended Action:** Extract loading logic into a dedicated LoadingService

### 3. GamePhaseManager (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**File:** `lib/game/services/game/game_phase_manager.dart`  
**Lines:** 21-104  
**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Effort:** MEDIUM  
**Why it matters:** Observer pattern implementation can be extracted and reused across multiple managers.

**Recommended Action:** Create PhaseChangeNotifier mixin

### 4. Main Entry Point (LOW PRIORITY)
**File:** `lib/main.dart`  
**Lines:** 6-13  
**Impact:** LOW  
**Effort:** LOW  
**Why it matters:** Platform configuration should be in a dedicated service for better testability.

**Recommended Action:** Create PlatformConfigurationService

## Files with Excellent SRP Adherence

Reference these files as examples of good SRP practices:

1. `lib/game/services/card/card_loader_service.dart` - Single purpose: loading cards from JSON
2. `lib/screens/services/game_navigation_service.dart` - Single purpose: game navigation
3. `lib/game/services/initialization/game_state_factory.dart` - Single purpose: game state creation
4. `lib/game/coordinators/common/reactive_coordinator.dart` - Single purpose: change notification
5. `lib/game/services/turn/player_turn_lifecycle_manager.dart` - Single purpose: turn lifecycle

## Implementation Notes

### Before Starting Any Refactoring:
1. Ensure all tests pass: `flutter test`
2. Create a new branch for each refactoring
3. Refactor one violation at a time
4. Run tests after each change
5. Update documentation as needed

### Testing Strategy:
- Unit test each new extracted class independently
- Update existing integration tests as needed
- Ensure test coverage doesn't decrease

### Code Review Checklist:
- [ ] Does the new class have a single, clear responsibility?
- [ ] Can the class be tested in isolation?
- [ ] Does the class have minimal dependencies?
- [ ] Is the public API simple and focused?
- [ ] Does the change improve or maintain test coverage?

## Benefits of Addressing These Violations

### Immediate Benefits:
- Improved testability
- Easier debugging
- Better code organization
- Clearer responsibilities

### Long-term Benefits:
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Reduced coupling between components
- More reusable code
- Easier to add new features
- Lower maintenance costs
